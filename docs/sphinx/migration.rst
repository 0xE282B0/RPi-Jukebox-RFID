Migration Path
**************

There is no update path coming from Version 2.x of the Jukebox.
You will need to remove the 2.x Jukebox installation manually and then do a fresh install of Version 3.

.. note:: The recommended way is to start with a fresh SD card image.

If you do not want to wipe your SD card, follow this procedure:

#. Disable all Phoniebox services, reboot
#. Remove/Rename the current Phoniebox working directory
#. Run the :ref:`installer script <install:Install Phoniebox software>`

Do not just pull the future3 branch into you existing Version 2.x directory.
Stuff has changed too much to make this feasible.
